                    The Sonic the Hedgehog video game series is a long-running franchise developed by Sega, centered
                    around Sonic, a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog known for his incredible speed. First introduced in
                    1991 as Sega's mascot and a rival to Nintendo’s Mario, the series quickly gained popularity for its
                    fast-paced platforming gameplay, colorful graphics, and energetic music. Players typically control
                    Sonic as he battles the evil Dr. Robotnik (also known as Dr. Eggman), who plots to conquer the world
                    using robotic creations. Over the years, the series has expanded to include a wide cast of
                    characters—like Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow—and has explored a variety of genres, from 2D
                    side-scrollers to 3D action-adventure games. Despite ups and downs in critical reception, Sonic the
                    Hedgehog remains one of the most iconic and enduring franchises in video game history.

                        The first Sonic the Hedgehog game, released by Sega in 1991 for the Sega Genesis, introduced
                        players to Sonic, a blue hedgehog with super speed, on a mission to stop the evil Dr. Robotnik
                        from taking over the world. Robotnik has captured animals and transformed them into robotic
                        minions to help him collect the powerful Chaos Emeralds. Set across seven vibrant zones—each
                        divided into three acts—the game challenges players to navigate loops, springs, and hazards
                        while freeing animals and collecting rings for protection. With its fast-paced platforming,
                        iconic Green Hill Zone, and catchy soundtrack, the original Sonic the Hedgehog was both a
                        critical and commercial success, helping to establish Sega as a major force in the gaming
                        industry.

                    <p>
                        Sonic the Hedgehog 2, released in 1992 for the Sega Genesis, is the sequel to the original hit
                        and expanded on its predecessor with faster gameplay, new features, and the introduction of
                        Sonic’s sidekick, Miles “Tails” Prower, a two-tailed fox who can fly. The game follows Sonic
                        and Tails as they race through diverse zones to stop Dr. Robotnik’s latest plan: building the
                        Death Egg, a massive space station, and turning animals into robots to fuel his army. Featuring
                        improved graphics, more intricate level design, the iconic “Spin Dash” move, and a two-player
                        mode, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 became one of the best-selling Sega Genesis games and is often
                        praised as one of the greatest platformers of its era.

                    <img class="P2" src="../persona-images/P2EP_Box_Art.jpg" alt="Persona 2: Eternal Punishment"/>
                    <p>
                        Persona 2: Eternal Punishment, the direct sequel to Innocent Sin, shifts focus to Maya
                        Amano, a
                        journalist investigating a new wave of reality-altering rumors in Sumaru City. Set in an
                        alternate timeline where the events of Innocent Sin were erased from memory, the game
                        explores
                        the consequences of those lost events as Maya and her allies, including returning
                        characters,
                        confront a new incarnation of the Joker and a deeper conspiracy involving fate, free will,
                        and
                        the nature of sin. As the characters awaken their Personas and delve into their own regrets
                        and
                        unresolved trauma, Eternal Punishment presents a mature, emotionally layered story that
                        challenges players with moral ambiguity and philosophical questions. The game completes the
                        Persona 2 duology, delivering a darker, more introspective narrative that further solidifies
                        the
                        series’ reputation for complex storytelling.

                    <p>
                        Persona 3, released in 2006, marks a major evolution in the series, blending traditional
                        dungeon-crawling RPG mechanics with a daily life simulation set in a modern Japanese high
                        school. The story follows a silent protagonist who transfers to Gekkoukan High School and
                        becomes involved with SEES (Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad), a group of
                        students
                        fighting mysterious creatures called Shadows during a hidden hour of the day known as the
                        "Dark
                        Hour." Using their Personas—summoned through an intense ritual involving evoker devices—the
                        group explores a massive tower called Tartarus while unraveling the truth behind the Dark
                        Hour,
                        the nature of death, and humanity’s struggle with existential despair. Persona 3 introduced
                        the
                        Social Link system and a darker, more philosophical tone that redefined the series, earning
                        it
                        critical acclaim and a lasting legacy as one of the most influential JRPGs of its time.

                        inside television screens. The protagonist, a transfer student, discovers the power to
                        summon
                        Personas and joins forces with classmates to investigate the “Midnight Channel,” a
                        supernatural
                        realm where people’s hidden feelings manifest as dangerous Shadows. As they confront and
                        accept
                        their darker selves, the team grows closer, strengthening their bonds and abilities.
                        Blending
                        murder mystery, psychological introspection, and heartfelt character development, Persona 4
                        stands out for its balance of lighthearted slice-of-life moments with darker, emotional

                    <p>
                        Persona 5, released in 2016, centers on a high school student wrongfully accused of assault
                        who
                        transfers to Shujin Academy in Tokyo and awakens to the power of Persona after discovering a

                        striking visual design.
