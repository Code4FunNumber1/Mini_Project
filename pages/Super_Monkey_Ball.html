                    Super Monkey Ball is a fast-paced platform and party video game series developed by Sega, known for
                    its unique gameplay that combines precision, physics-based movement, and arcade-style challenges.
                    Players control a monkey encased in a transparent ball, navigating it through increasingly complex
                    and hazard-filled courses by tilting the entire stage, rather than moving the character directly.
                    The series debuted in arcades in 2001 and gained popularity with its Nintendo GameCube launch,
                    praised for its tight controls, challenging level design, and addictive mini-games. Over the years,
                    Super Monkey Ball has expanded across multiple platforms, maintaining its core gameplay while
                    introducing new features, characters, and modes to appeal to both casual and competitive players.

                        Super Monkey Ball is an arcade-style platform game where players guide a monkey trapped inside a
                        transparent ball through a series of increasingly challenging obstacle courses. Instead of
                        directly controlling the character, players tilt the entire stage to roll the ball toward the
                        goal within a time limit, requiring precision, timing, and quick reflexes. The game features a
                        variety of single-player stages as well as multiplayer mini-games, including racing, bowling,
                        and target-hitting challenges. Known for its simple controls, vibrant visuals, and high
                        difficulty curve, Super Monkey Ball combines skill-based gameplay with a lighthearted, energetic
                        atmosphere.

                    <h2>Super Monkey Ball 2</h2>
                    <img src="../images/super-monkey-ball-images/SMB2_Box_Art.jpg" alt="SuperMonkeyBall_Box_Art"/>
                    <p>
                        Super Monkey Ball 2 is the sequel to the original arcade-style platformer, expanding on its core
                        gameplay with a full story mode, new stage mechanics, and a wider variety of multiplayer
                        options. Players once again roll monkeys encased in balls through challenging, maze-like stages
                        by tilting the environment, but this time across themed worlds tied together by a lighthearted
                        narrative featuring the evil Dr. Bad-Boon. The game introduces new obstacles such as moving
                        platforms, switches, and teleporters, adding more variety and complexity to the puzzles. In
                        addition to the main mode, Super Monkey Ball 2 includes a robust party game lineup and
                        competitive mini-games, making it a favorite for both solo players and multiplayer sessions.

                    <h2>Super Monkey Ball Adventure</h2>
                    <img src="../images/super-monkey-ball-images/SMBA_Box_Art.jpg" alt="SuperMonkeyBall_Box_Art"/>
                    <p>
                        Super Monkey Ball Adventure is a spin-off in the Super Monkey Ball series that blends
                        traditional ball-rolling gameplay with open-world exploration and story-driven platforming.
                        Developed by Traveller’s Tales and released in 2006, the game introduces players to five monkey
                        kingdoms, where they complete quests, solve puzzles, and restore happiness to the world by
                        navigating both free-roaming environments and classic challenge stages. Unlike previous entries,
                        it features dialogue, a heavier focus on narrative, and a more adventure-style structure, while
                        still incorporating the physics-based rolling mechanics the series is known for. Though it
                        received mixed reviews due to control and design issues, Super Monkey Ball Adventure remains a
                        unique experiment within the franchise.

                    <h2>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz</h2>
                    <img src="../images/super-monkey-ball-images/SMBBB_Box_Art.jpg" alt="SMBBB_Box_Art"/>
                    <p>
                        Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz is a vibrant, fast-paced entry in the Super Monkey Ball series,
                        originally released for the Nintendo Wii in 2006. Designed to take advantage of the Wii's motion
                        controls, the game lets players tilt the stage using the Wii Remote to roll their
                        monkey-in-a-ball through a variety of colorful, hazard-filled levels. It introduces several new
                        gameplay elements, including boss battles and the ability to jump, which adds a new layer of
                        strategy and platforming to the classic formula. In addition to the main story mode, Banana
                        Blitz features 50 party games, offering a wide range of multiplayer mini-games. Though opinions
                        were mixed due to control sensitivity and mini-game variety, the game was later re-released as
                        Banana Blitz HD with improved controls and updated visuals.

                    <p>
                        Super Monkey Ball: Banana Splitz is a handheld entry in the Super Monkey Ball series, released
                        for the PlayStation Vita in 2012. Staying true to the franchise’s core mechanics, the game
                        challenges players to guide a monkey inside a ball through increasingly complex stages by
                        tilting the environment, using either the system’s motion sensors or analog stick controls.
                        It features over 100 levels across themed worlds, as well as a selection of party games and a
                        level creation mode that utilizes the Vita’s camera to generate custom stages from photos. While
                        praised for its bright visuals and faithful gameplay, Banana Splitz received mixed reviews due
                        to its inconsistent level design and underwhelming mini-games.

                    <h2>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania</h2>
                    <img src="../images/super-monkey-ball-images/SMBBM_Box_Art.jpg" alt="SMBBM_Box_Art"/>
                    <p>
                        Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is a modern remaster celebrating the 20th anniversary of the
                        series, released in 2021 for multiple platforms. It faithfully recreates over 300 levels from
                        Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe with updated visuals,
                        refined physics, and quality-of-life improvements, such as optional helper features and
                        accessibility options. The game retains the classic gameplay of tilting stages to roll monkeys
                        through intricate obstacle courses while adding new content like time trials, missions, and a
                        wide roster of playable characters—including guest appearances from other Sega franchises.
                        Banana Mania was well-received for its nostalgic value, improved presentation, and being the
                        most complete package in the series to date.

                    <p>

                        marks a return to the series’ core gameplay while adding modern twists. Players still roll
                        monkeys inside balls by tilting stages, racing against the clock to reach goals, but there’s
                        now a Spin Dash mechanic for bursts of speed and shortcut potential. The game includes a
                        200‑stage Adventure Mode (solo or up to four‑player co‑op, locally or online), plus multiplayer
                        and battle modes supporting up to 16 players with modes like Race, Banana Hunt, Goal Rush, Robot

                        assist options for newer players, and a story involving the Legendary Banana and a new
                        character, Palette.
