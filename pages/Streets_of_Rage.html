                    Streets of Rage is a classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up video game series developed and published by
                    Sega, originally debuting in 1991 on the Sega Genesis. The series follows a group of vigilante
                    ex-police officers—Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding, and others—as they fight to clean up their
                    crime-ridden city from the grip of the nefarious crime lord Mr. X and his criminal syndicate. Known
                    for its fast-paced brawler gameplay, vibrant pixel art, and especially its iconic electronic dance
                    music soundtracks composed by Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima, Streets of Rage has become a
                    beloved franchise in retro gaming. After a long hiatus, the series was revived with Streets of Rage
                    4 in 2020, which introduced updated visuals and gameplay while staying true to the spirit of the
                    originals.

                        Streets of Rage is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up game released by Sega in 1991 for the Sega
                        Genesis. The game follows three former police officers—Axel, Blaze, and Adam—who take to the
                        streets to battle a powerful criminal syndicate led by the mysterious Mr. X, after corruption
                        spreads through the city’s police force. Players fight through eight gritty urban levels filled
                        with waves of enemies, using punches, kicks, throws, and special moves, including a powerful
                        police backup attack that clears the screen. Renowned for its co-op multiplayer, tight combat
                        mechanics, and a groundbreaking electronic soundtrack by Yuzo Koshiro, Streets of Rage became a
                        defining title of the 16-bit era and set the stage for its popular sequels.
