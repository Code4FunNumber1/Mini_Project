                    beloved franchise in retro gaming. After a long hiatus, the series was revived with Streets of Rage
                    4 in 2020, which introduced updated visuals and gameplay while staying true to the spirit of the
                    originals.

                        Streets of Rage is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up game released by Sega in 1991 for the Sega
                        Genesis. The game follows three former police officers—Axel, Blaze, and Adam—who take to the
                        streets to battle a powerful criminal syndicate led by the mysterious Mr. X, after corruption
                        spreads through the city’s police force. Players fight through eight gritty urban levels filled
                        with waves of enemies, using punches, kicks, throws, and special moves, including a powerful
                        police backup attack that clears the screen. Renowned for its co-op multiplayer, tight combat
                        mechanics, and a groundbreaking electronic soundtrack by Yuzo Koshiro, Streets of Rage became a
                        defining title of the 16-bit era and set the stage for its popular sequels.

                        Streets of Rage 3, released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis, is the third installment in the iconic
                        beat 'em up series. The game continues the saga of vigilante heroes Axel, Blaze, and Skate,
                        joined by newcomer Dr. Zan, as they face a new threat from Mr. X and his sinister robotics
                        organization, RoboCy. The plot involves a conspiracy to replace key city officials with robotic
                        clones, adding a sci-fi twist to the classic brawler formula. With faster gameplay, new moves,
                        branching story paths, and a more complex narrative than its predecessors, Streets of Rage 3
                        pushed the series forward, though it received mixed reactions due to its increased difficulty
                        and censorship changes in its Western release.
